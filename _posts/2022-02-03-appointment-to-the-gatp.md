Today, I was appointed to the WashU Genome Analysis Training Program (GATP). The
program name may be unfamiliar as it's specific to the institution, but the this
program is funded by the NHGRI grant T32 which is officially titled
"Institutional training grant in genomic science". Now, let's just note what
this appointment actually entails.

As this grant is for training students for genome analysis, it expects
appointees take courses that fulfill requirements in computer programming,
probability and statistics, cell and molecular biology, and genome technologies
and computational biology. The first two I should already have satisfied with
courses taken in my undergraduate university. However, because I have not taken
an actual college-level biology course, I will need to take courses here at
WashU to fulfill the latter two requirements.

What's also interesting is that this grant sponsors attendance of the annual
NHGRI Research Training and Career Development Annual Meeting which happens each
spring. The next one is in a few weeks at Duke University. They expect that
trainees give poster presentations and considering the deadline to submit a PDF
poster is in less than a week, it's a little daunting.

I think this appointment is going to be a good opportunity for me. It's been
about 9 months since I've joined the Brent Lab and I have noticed my limited
knowledge of biology and genomics holding me back occasionally. The required
courses and opportunities to communicate my project ideas and results with
experts in the area will be useful in setting my foot in the field.
