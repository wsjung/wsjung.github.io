Today marks the third week since the start of my PhD program at Washington
University at St. Louis. Inspired by fellow PhD student Saumik, I've decided to
commit to writing a weekly blog to track the progress of my maturation as a PhD
student. You can check out Saumik's website here.

New to the blogging scene, the first few posts will be littered with rough edges
and the website in general will be rather bland. I have lately felt a need to
write as it has been years since the days of writing-intensive liberal arts
courses resulting in a noticeable degradation in my writing and flow of thinking
in general. Hopefully this commitment to weekly blogging will help develop a
writing habit that will keep me thinking and bring some structure to this
disorderly COVID-19 schedule.

Besides the goal of putting my life together again, writing is a crucial skill
to hone as a PhD student. During the next several years, I will need to write
numerous papers on prestigious journals and conferences whose primary audience
is other scientists in the field. This will require a very specific set of
writing skills. Scientific writing must communication scientific information in
a concise and precise manner. Flowery, ambiguous, verbose, and redundant
language have no place in this writing style. The ultimate goal of a PhD is to
write a dissertation that is typically hundreds of pages long. According to this
blog post, the average length of a computer science doctoral dissertation from a
sample gathered at the University of Minnesota database is 103 pages. The hope
is that this weekly blogging project will make the seemingly daunting task more
achieveable.

At the moment, I am not too sure what kind of content I will be writing on. I
will most likely choose to write on what I learned during the course of the
week. These may consist of organized notes on lecture material or particular
topics that I have found interesting and have taken a further look at. The
makeup of my blog posts will change as I continue with my program. I can already
sense that I will be writing my own takes on research papers I have read to gain
a better understanding of the subject matter.

Hopefully at the end of my PhD, I can look back at all the blog posts I have
written and feel accomplished with not only the improvement of quality of
writing but just the sheer amount I will have written over the years.
