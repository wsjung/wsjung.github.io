As my third lab rotation I joined Dr. Michael Brent's Computational Genomics
lab. Genomics is a rather foreign subject for me as it's been over 8 years since
I've touched anything Biology related. Actually, I have done a project in my
last years as an undergraduate under Dr. Adam Smith where we tried to simulate
mouse and bird vocalizations via GANs. Yet, genomics still felt very much out of
reach when I started my rotation.

With a lot of Wikipedia articles, youtube videos, and paper reading I have
garnered few bits of Genomics knowledge over the rotation period. Specifically,
I have learned a lot about the structure and function of genes and gene
regulation. During the rotation, I was tasked with getting up to speed with the
codebase of an existing pre-print:
[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.15.422864v1](Predicting which
genes will respond to perturbations of a TF: TF-independent properties of genes
are major determinants of their responsiveness.) I was able to find some
alternative perspectives on existing results under the direction of Dr. Brent.

I found my experiences during this rotation exciting and decided to join the lab
officially! I am happy with how supportive the lab members are especially
considering I have little to no background Genomics knowledge. Fun fact is that
many graduate researchers in the lab also started out on a similar note,
expanding their knowledge base over the years.

For the immediate future, I will continue working on the pre-print that I have
been working on during the rotation, applying the technique to a completely
different dataset to see whether we arrive at similar results. 

I'm really happy with the results of this rotation and look forward to what
projects I will undertake as a member of the Brent Lab.
