*About Me:* I am a PhD candidate at the [Washington University in St.
Louis](https://washu.edu) in Computer Science under the guidance of [Dr. Michael
Brent](https://engineering.washu.edu/faculty/Michael-Brent.html). My research primarily involves the study of
**transcriptional regulation** and its role in **exceptional longevity**. Prior to pursuing my
doctorage degree, I obtained my Bachelors in Mathematics and Computer Science
from the the [University of Puget Sound](https://www.pugetsound.edu/).
