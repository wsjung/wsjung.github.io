      "summary": "This study introduces a multi-omics framework that integrates metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic data using machine learning and semi-supervised network inference to model small moleculeâ€“gene interactions. The approach outperforms existing methods in identifying biologically meaningful networks and reveals novel insights into insulin sensitivity, including links between gut microbiota metabolites and immune pathways. The resulting networks, validated in a large, long-lived human cohort, are made publicly available to support further research."
